# Timetable Scheduling, using an Evolution (genetic) Algorithm

Implementing an Evolution Algorithm, used to solve timetable scheduling problems.  
We built a generic evolution-engine that repeatedly applied 3 functions: selection, crossover and mutation,  
to a population of solutions, in order to reach an optimal solution.  
On top of the generic engine, we added a timetablespecific-engine and graded the fitness of the solutions using a set of given rules.  
In the 1st phase we implemented a console application.  
In the 2nd phase we implemented a JavaFX UI and adapted the backend accordingly.  
In the 3rd and final phase, we transformed the entire project into a web application, with React front-end, and Tomcat back-end.
